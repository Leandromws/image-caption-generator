# README - Python application for image analysis and caption generation using the Google Vision API and ChatGPT

## Description
This repository contains a Python application that uses the Google Vision API to analyze an image provided by the user and generate a list of labels that describe the content of the image. The application then uses the natural language model ChatGPT to generate a caption based on the labels generated by the Google Vision API.

## How to use
To use this application, follow the steps below:

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed, along with all necessary dependencies, including the `google-cloud-vision`, `google-auth`, and `google-auth-oauthlib` libraries.

2. Download or clone the repository to your computer.

3. Create a Google Cloud Platform account and create a project to use the Google Vision API. Follow the detailed instructions in the `official Google Cloud Vision documentation`_ to set up your account.

4. Activate the Google Vision API in your project and generate an authentication key. To do this, follow the detailed instructions in the `official Google Cloud Vision documentation`_ to generate an authentication key.

5. Create an account on OpenAI and obtain an API key. Follow the instructions in the `official OpenAI documentation`_ to set up your account and obtain an API key.

6. Copy the `config.example.json` file to `config.json` and edit the file to insert your authentication keys for both Google Vision and OpenAI.

7. Run the `main.py` file and input your url image.

8. Wait for the image analysis to complete and the caption generated by the ChatGPT API to be displayed on the screen.
